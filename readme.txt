== Description ==

Plugin will create lots of users, messages, friends connections, groups, topics, activity items, profile data - useful for testing purpose.

All imported users will have avatars, generated by 8biticon.com and displayed by Gravatar.

Please use this plugin with caution and not on a live site! Again, USE FOR TESTING THEMES AND PLUGINGS, NOT ON A STAGING SITE WITH LIVE DATA.

Clear BuddyPress button will truncate tables: messages, groups, notifications, friends, forum posts, xprofile. All users except one with ID=1 and all corresponding data (usermeta, activity etc) will be deleted too.

And turn off email notifications in profile (friendship accepted and messages received) - or you will spam yourself :) Imported users have these settings already turned off.
